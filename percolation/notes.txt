1. For each problem, state its goal in your own words and describe your approach to solve the 
problem along with any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve those issues.

Problem 1 (Percolation Data Type): ...

Goal: The goal is to create a percolation data type that models an n x n grid.

Approach: I will implement the methods provided step by step first constructing the n x n percolation system. Ensure that the exceptions are thrown where necessary 

Problem 2 (Estimation of Percolation Threshold): ...

Goal: The goal is to estimate the percolation threshold using Monte Carlo simulation by running multiple independent experiments. 

Approach: I will implement the methods provided step by step, first I will perform independent experiments on an n Ã— n percolation system. For each experiment, I'll create a new Percolation
