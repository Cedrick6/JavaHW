1. For each problem, state its goal in your own words and describe your approach to solve the 
problem along with any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve those issues.

[Problem 1 (Compute Edit Distance)]

Goal: To find the edit distance between two DNA sequences with the global sequence alignment. The program will create the dynamic matrix opt

Approach: First, I used the provided helper methods charAt, length, and min to simplify working with strings and calculate the min penalties. I created a buildDistance method to construct the edit distance matrix by dynamic prog. Lastly, I made a printing method that loops through the matrix to print it in a formatted way

[Problem 2 (Recover Alignment)]

Goal: To recover an optimal alignment of two DNA seq by retracing the choices in the edit distance matrix and print each aligned pair with its associated penalty. 

Approach: First, I created a recoverAlignment method that goes through the prev matrix from the start. At each step, it looks at the next cells to decide if two char should be matched or if gap should be added. I used the helper methods charAt and length to get characters from the strings and to know the matrix size.
