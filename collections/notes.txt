1. For each problem, state its goal in your own words and describe your approach to solve the 
problem along with any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve those issues.

[Problem 1 (Deque)]

Goal: The goal is to implement a double ended queue using a doubly linked list that let you add and remove items from both the front and back. 

Approach: I first went over the template code and understood what I needed to do, I then tackled it one method at a time making sure I follow the instructions to get the outcome required.

[Problem 2 (Random Queue)]

Goal: The goal is to implement a random queue using a resizing array where items are removed uniformly at random and iterators produce independent random orderings.

Approach: I first went over the template code and understood what I needed to do, I then tackled it one method at a time making sure I follow the instructions to get the outcome required.
